Behavior:
 
This modal pop up should only appear when using the master login, not when a regular customer places an order
 
This modal pop up should appear when the order summary page loads so first they have to confirm on the modal pop up and then they can review everything and click on REQUEST ORDER at the bottom

Story;CODEE01-500;Highest;Closed;Update order statuses & integrate AD numbers;12-07-2023;"Expected order process & statuses: 

1. Customer requests the order in the eShop
● Status = Waiting for Approval 
2. Order gets replicated in QAD
3. Customer service amends the order in QAD (adds products, adjusts quantities, adds freight fees, adds discount at header level...) and marks order as confirmed (they have to go through actions on the QAD browse to confirm it, they can't just tick the box)
4. Customer has to confirm / reject the order on the order detail page (they get notified by email) --> This step is specific to export
5. When customer has confirmed the order but the AD number is not yet generated --> This step is specific to export as well
● Status = In Progress
6. AD number gets manually created in QAD by Bev (AD is everything related to shipping)
● Status = Picking
● AD = Bill of Lading in QAD, see screenshots 3 and 4
● We should show the AD number that we can find at line level in QAD on the order detail page, see screenshot 3
● 1 order can have multiple AD numbers, but there is only 1 AD number open per shipment --> Once the products are picked and the shipment is complete then the existing AD number disappears and the next AD number can be created (against a back order for example)
● 1 AD number can have multiple orders
● We won't be able to test this in UAT because it's linked to QAD TEST and Bev is not able to generate the AD number in QAD test, also we have to generate the AD number through the application and we cannot do it through the WEB UI so we will even have to ask Bev for help when testing on PROD
7. Financial invoice number gets generated once the order has been processed through TMS and then posted by the accounts team 
● Status = Complete but only once every single line of the order has been shipped
● There can be multiple financial invoice numbers for a single order
● We should show the financial invoice number on the order detail page if we can => Keep for V2 
The statuses should be updated on the order history tables and the order detail page, and it's valid for eShop & external (QAD) orders --> See the first 2 screenshots
 
 
 
Expected order refresh logic:

● Orders should be refreshed every hour
● We should only refresh orders that are marked as confirmed

UPDATE following our pricing meeting with business on 12/06:
 
Export:

● We have a net price list per customer
● SF will only use the field “list price” => See the below screenshot
● Right now we don't have EX at the beginning of all export price list names in QAD PROD but business will update it
● Below are the price lists names in QAD, business is in the process of updating them to the new names and latest prices:
    ◦ ABCDE21=> ABCDE23
    ◦ ABCDE21 => ABCDE23
    ◦ ABCDE21 => ABCDE23 
         
 
 
 
Domestic:

● Calculation (see the second screenshot for an illustration): start from the list price (which is our base price = 33.08 in the first screenshot), remove the standard discount (UKST, 45%) and then from this remove the extra discount at customer level
● 2 options for the new UK pricing logic for all of their customers except Amazon (10160), PPG EUOR (10130)and Halfords(10150) (business has not yet decided which logic to implement but their favorite is the first):In QAD test we have the standard discount file but we can’t see the net price anymore => Business needs to add the net price to keep using this logicMove to the same model as export, meaning one net price file per customer 
In SF we should test option 1 for now as that is business' favorite:

● In SF we will save the base price and the final price that customer will pay

I want to see the inco terms 
 
So that I have the correct and up to date information
 
 
 
Acceptance criteria:
 
Account page

● Add a field to show the inco terms on the account page (the field in QAD is called freight terms) => See the second screenshot 
Order detail page

● Add a field for inco terms on the order detail page (the field in QAD is called freight terms) => See the first screenshot 
For both pages

● We should show the value of inco terms for example DAP
● We should also show the description of the value for example DAP = delivered at place so the B2B buyer understands it => We need to implement a mapping between the value and the description 
● The B2B buyer should not be able to modify this field, it's read only (only User 2 can change the inco term value directly in QAD)
● Note that the inco terms at account level can be different than the inco terms at order level, which is why we have to show it on both pages

New custom field to be created on the Contact Point Address object to store the ship to ID in Salesforce (as External ID)

 

Meeting with :

UPDATE BY projet manager
 
1) We are getting all shipping addresses from MDM/QAD, customer cannot insert a new address while checking out on eShop
 
projet manager to get an export of shipping address countries from MDM so designer  can do the mapping between the country and the delivery method
 
I'm still waiting for the MDM export, but if you want to start testing you can map these countries to the UK for now: England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland. 
 
 
 
2) Delivery methods
 
Domestic (UK) has only 1 option (customer service will decide if it's Fedex or User 2hews carrier based on the weight): Standard 
 
screenshot
 screenshot      
 
Export (all other countries) has 4 options: Air, Sea, Road, Courier
 
             
 
 
3) Shipping fees
Domestic (UK): if order is equal or more than 500£ then free shipping / if order is less than 500£ then 15£ shipping fee
 
Disclaimer: Delivery within 5 working days.
 
Export (all other countries): they are calculated by User 2 once he reviews the order in QAD
Disclaimer: Lead time and shipping fees will be calculated after the order is placed
 
Field in QAD, business will confirm what the 10/20/30 means
 
         
 
4) 2 step check out process for export

● Customer places order in eShop
● Customer service reviews order and possibly makes changes to products and quantities in QAD
● Updates in QAD flow to SF so orders are updated in SF
● SF to send email to customer saying order was updated (template to be provided by projet manager), includes link to order detail page
● Customer goes to order detail page and there is a drop down field asking them to approve the changes -> Order is flagged as approved  
 
 
5) These fields should be mandatory: purchase order number, shipping address, delivery method
 
These fields should be optional: desired delivery date, delivery instructions 
 
6) For the desired delivery date, we should not be able to select a date in the past + we can remove the time field as date is enough, we won't be able to guarantee an exact time.
 
7) The last call to action button on the last page of the checkout should not say NEXT but REQUEST AN ORDER 
 
8) For export, please remove the 0.00£ for shipping fees, as there is already a disclaimer saying they will be calculated once the order is placed
 
9) Once the order has been placed, please change the title to: YOUR ORDER REQUEST HAS BEEN PLACED SUCCESSFULLY.
 
And remove this sentence: Your order is complete.";;;;;

  Let’s imagine a customer orders 500 pieces but we only have 300 in stock, and they want those now. So we ship 300 and keep 200 in backorder while we manufacture them.
 
● 
 
  The sales order will stay open, it’s not a new sales order that gets created for the remaining 200 pieces.
 
● 
 
  We will have 2 financial invoices and 2 pack notes against that single sales order.

  What customer service sends to the customer via email are the 2 financial invoices because that is what they pay against.

Configure product filters.

 

As a business

So that I can have all platforms in one style and reduce clients confusion

 

Updated by projet manager:
● We need to configure these filters (I know there are only 3 on the Figma but this has been confirmed by PO), the values of each filter can be found in our Teams group here (check the tab called “picklists”): Product Template for Loading to B2B Dev - With SFDC FIELDs.xlsx
    ◦ Market (column J)
    ◦ Surface (column I)
    ◦ Type (column G)
    ◦ Range (column E)
    ◦ User profile (column F, I know it’s called “user type” in the file but please name it as user profile on the storefront)
    ◦ Pack size (column A, I know it’s called “SKU variant” in the file but please name it as pack size on the storefront) 
● Renaming the filters in the future is possible --> please include this in the userguide (for example changing the term “market” to “industry”)
● When a user selects a filter, the page should dynamically update with the products that fit the criteria
● Product cards: Put the first pack size by default so the user can directly change the quantities and add to cart if the pack size by default is correct instead of clicking on the drop down and selecting a pack size, this is the standard in SF
● Salesforce provides a lot of options to sort besides 'Best Match' like sorting by product fields, asc desc and so on. Commerce admin can configure all these options. --> please include this in the userguide
● By default, 20 product cards are shown on the listing page before adding pagination, but this can be changed by the admin --> please include this in the userguide";;;;;

Update on January 20  ( next to a call with  and Noemie) 

 

Issue identified : 
 1. As a user I navigate on the website and consult a page that is not the home (any page doesn't User 2er what ex : https://www.monurl.com  ) 

2. On the page consulted, I click on the selector and change the language (ex : From english select french ) 

3. The url that we get is in english whereas the content is in french  https://www.monurl.com 

4. Navigate on the main menu, and click on whatever other page (ex : Produit > Filtre ) 

5. The url we get is in french[ https://www.monurl.com 

6. From there, if you navigate every url would be in french (even the one that was in english at step 3) 

=> Same behaviour with every pages, exept home , the url of first page after using selector is in english whatever the language you choose (just url not content) 

 

Behaviour expected : 

1. After using the language selector, the url should be one the correct language. 
 A few exemples : 

French : https://www.monurl.com/fr/products/ should be  ** https://www.monurl.com/fr/produits
 German : https://www.monurl.com/de/products/ should be https://www.monurl.com/de/produkte/ **

Story;CODEESS-314;Highest;Closed;Change Request -  News block;15-03-2021;"Hello, 
 
On the news and event page, instead of the cards block, we want to have a news block. 

1. This block would build dynamically based on the news details being created. The cards should generate the news in order by the newest news (at the top left) to appear to the oldest one (at the bottom).
2. By default it would show 9 news and then we would have a load more button to load older news on the page. 
3. In the B/O, we need to create a new field in the dates tab. It will be called ""end date"". When the date of this field hits, then the news is removed from all the blocks (related content, wayfindings, cards, etc) except from this block. 
4. For the style of load more, we should have the same as the one on the event page : https://monurl.com

5. For the style of the overall block, please apply the same design as the cards block. It front should match the figma design.

Story;CODEESS-343;Highest;Closed;Change Request - Footer;25-03-2021;"I have noticed that in the footer you have made the sections required instead of optional.



In the original discussions we had identified that not all businesses would use every section and so we would want to make it optional to add the address section or the social links section so we will need hide the sections not populated by the business.

Also, I can no longer find how to edit the first section which used to allow us to put a secondary logo and caption,

*********************************************

To do : 
1. On the first section (logo and name of company) 
    a. The first logo should redirect to monurl.com and should open in a new tab 
    b. We need to add a second logo (will be redirecting to the homepage of the site, in the same tab) and a second company name . They should be optionnal.
2. On the address section:
    a. On the front, remove the display for the two labels ""address"" and ""phone"". 
    b. Change the content to be left justify
3. The address section and the social links section should be optionnal. If not filled, they shouldn't be displayed in the front. (Right now it creates a blanck space)

Pin Numbers

● The numbers currently have a white outline, which can disappear against a white background (example for pin 1 in screenshot below). I suggest removing the outline entirely. This would also match the styling of the numbered pins in the right-hand titles, which do not have contours.

Expected result:

● When I search for ""micro"" I should see products with that term in the product name
● I think we need to give more weight to the product name
● I think the product description should have less weight than the product name
● I don't think we should give any weight to the description of the recommended products because those are other PDP

Story;CODEE01-509;High;Closed;PLP: Update product cards;13-07-2023;"Actual result: 

1. We have variations grouped under parent
2. We do not see the price for parent when there are variations => Linked to point 1
3. We do not see the size => Linked to point 1
4. We have this information
    a. Minimum quantity is X
    b. Maximum quantity is X
    c. Sold in increments of X 
Expected result:

1. We should NOT group variations under parent => Serhiy is working on it, he will reload the product file to UAT today 28/07 in        CODEExx-xxx   
2. We should see the price directly => I think this will be fixed with point 1
3. We saw with Dev that when we do not group variations under parent (point 1) we have a new field called SKU Variant that appears automatically on the product card, we need to hide the label SKU Variant with CSS and just display the size
4. We should have this information somewhere on the product card
    a. SKU 
    b. Sold in increments of X => Already there

UPDATED DESCRIPTION BY projet manager:
● There will be 2 SKU on the product page: 1 Business SKU (at the top), 1 SGA SKU (in the product references tab). These will appear once the user has selected the size, as each size (1L, 2L) is it's own SKU.
● Product size: Allows customer to choose the size when a product has different sizes: 1L, 2L, 3L...
● There is only one ""available"" sign for now, later when we will add the stock information and when we see there is no stock we will display an ""out of stock"" sign, but do not take this into account for now, it's just for your information.
● For the quantity button, it should automatically show the minimum quantity, so let's imagine the minimum order quantity of 1 SKU is 5, then the quantity should automatically be at 5 and the user cannot select less than 5
● Bullet points: See 
  
   CODEExx-xxx
  
● 3 tabs:
    ◦ Product description: Will be taken from the product file
    ◦ Product references: SGA SKU, Barcode, Alternative barcode, country of origin => Will be taken from the product file
    ◦ Resources: fact sheets, process charts, safety data sheets => Will be manually uploaded in SF for the go live (the documents will be stored in Teams)
● Product recommandations are manual for the MVP
● Video rules
    ◦ 1 video (like in the Figma)
        ■ Main video component title (HOW TO VIDEO) which is mandatory
        ■ Video 1 title (Business PRODUCT A  which is optional
● 
    ◦ 2 videos or more
        ■ Main video component title (HOW TO VIDEO) which is mandatory
        ■ Accordeon video 1 title (because we will have many accordeons so it might look weird if there is just the accordeon icon with no subtitle, especially since first accordeon will be open but the others will be closed) which is optional
        ■ Video 1 title (Business Product A  which is optional
        ■ Accordeon video 2 title (so here we would have another subtitle) which is optional
        ■ Video 2 title (XXX) which is optional";;;;;

Story;CODEESS-506;High;Closed;GTM update for Business and business/others;21-09-2021;"I worked with Arjun today and he assisted me on a few improvements for the Business GTM which later we will want to apply to other sites.  In addition, as we cut over sites we need to remember to update the GOALS which were setup in the Global KPI view with some modifications. 

Arjun is setting up downloads to work for us but we do need the path you get when you click the preview or download to show as the actual site url, not prod-.  This is noted in another ticket but I wanted to mention this as a pre-req to getting GTM clarified. 

One open question is, once we get the GTM setup does IDS plan to export that plan and import it into other sites like business to work. I am asking because the agency 55 will be looking at our GTM in the next few weeks for GA 4 and some of the refinements we may want across all sites but I was unsure how you will produce the GTM for business and others.

Test : In mobile, when user has clicked once on the pin , the content section below is displayed (title + description + CTA). 
Issue : There is too much spacing within the cards (between the image, text, and CTA). 
 
Is it possible to reduce this space ?  
If yes, could you provide an estimation so we can acknowledge the complexity of it before confirming the prioritisation. 
 
Thanks

For pin titles with arrows, all in the blue Business color + not dynamic & no hover.
 
I suggest making it :

● dynamic,
● similar to what was developed for the CX table in Figma (arrow in sea green, then when hover, style changes as screenshot below).

Story;CODEE01-764;Medium;Closed;QAD Automated Script for Monitoring;16-10-2023;"Context: 

● We are integrated with the QAD WEB UI as there is no standard API and we do not have any active monitoring in place, just some logs and notifications when the integration breaks. 
 
 
Goal:

● We need to create a script that will automatically test the QAD WEB UI at a specified frequency, to ensure we can submit a full sales order without issue. 
 
 
Specifications:

● We should make the frequency settings manageable if we want to change it in the future.
● We need this script to run on  UAT which is connected to QAD TEST, I'm not sure we can run it on business PROD which is connected to QAD PROD but if it's possible to do without actually creating a sales order let's do it.
● This script should hit all the QAD WEB UI end points that we need to successfully create a sales order, please check the documentation link I put below where I started listing what I know.
● Once the script is executed, we need to send an email template to a distribution list where we can manage the emails of the people it should be sent to as some people can leave the project and new team members can come. We do not need to make the email templates beautiful like the ones we send to customer and customer service, just some text is fine. There are 3 scenarios that I can think of:
    ◦ The script runs and no errors are detected (scenario 1)
    ◦ The script runs and some errors are detected (scenario 2)
    ◦ The script is not able to run (scenario 3) 
 
 
Email templates:

● For testing please configure your email and projet manager's: exemple@email.com    
● Scenario 1: If the script runs and no errors are detected, automatically send the below email:
    ◦ Subject: Business QAD Script - SUCCESS
    ◦ Body: The script ran as expected and no errors were detected.
● Scenario 2: If the script runs and errors are detected, automatically send the below email:
    ◦ Subject: Business QAD Script - ERRORS
    ◦ Body: The script ran as expected but some errors were detected. The integration between Salesforce and QAD could be down, please investigate on priority. [Is it possible to list the error logs here?]
● Scenario 3: If the script is not able to run, automatically send the below email:
    ◦ Subject: Business QAD Script - UNABLE TO RUN
    ◦ Body: The script was unable to run as pld, please investigate.

Requirement 1: We should not be able to select a date in the past, right now we can select a date in the past but we will get an error when clicking on the next button, but actually all the dates in the past should be grayed out and not clickable so we cannot even select them

 

Requirement 2: For domestic only (UK and Ireland), we want to implement this logic for the desired dispatch date:
● If the order is placed before noon (12 PM) UK time, then the customer can select today as the desired dispatch date
● If the order is placed after noon (12 PM) UK time, then the customer cannot select today as the desired dispatch date, the first date the customer can select is tomorrow

This is because Business has a cut off at noon (12 PM) UK time.

Let's use the domestic buyer group for price since it's for UK and Ireland.

● Placement: At the top of the page before the 2 tables, maybe in this component we can add a title ORDER HISTORY so that we have a title for the page, then the search bar, then the 2 tables with their respective titles
● Logic: I should be able to search by order number (QAD order number that starts with SOXXXXX) and PO number
● Placeholder of the search bar: Enter order number or PO number
● Error: If I search for an order number or PO number that does not exist we should put this error message in red: You have entered an invalid order number or PO number, please try again.
● Behavior: When I press enter on my keyboard it should search for the order in the 2 tables and show the results
● Buttons: We also need a RESET button, you can put it on the right hand side and copy the style of the other reset button on the page
● Style: Can we copy the style of the quick add search bar? It looks nice

As discussed with the CRM & MDM team, regarding accounts (customers):
● We have to use the existing business  record type
● We need to create a checkbox to flag the account as Business
    ◦ If the checkbox is ticked = Business account
    ◦ If the checkbox is not ticked = business  account
● For PROD I will provide an extract from MDM with all the Business accounts so we can tick the checkbox manually
● For new accounts in the future, you talked about writing some APEX code to automatically tick this checkbox, I think first we will sync the account from MDM and then sync it from QAD, so if we find the account in QAD (UKAD) it means it's a Business account and we can tick the checkbox and get extra fields like inco terms, credit limit...

● Business will confirm in our CRM workshop on May 2 if we keep these separate record types & page layouts for Account & Contact for Business, or if we reuse the ones from business  => Confirmed with Projec manager & business in our CRM workshop of May 2nd that we will keep both record types & page layouts for Account & Contact separate for Business, so the work that our provider has done so far is correct and we don't have to change anything
● Naming of Account & Contact to be changed to be harmonized with other Business brands
    ◦ Account should be named : Business Customer
    ◦ Contact should be name : Business 
● Account creation
    ◦ In PROD we should not be able to create an Account directly in SF as MDM is the master (but it's fine to keep this option in DEV/UAT to test)
    ◦ Additional fields are requested by business, such as : supplier, type, SOA, email... =>  will provide the exact fields with their type (lookup, free text...) and mention if they are mandatory or not
● Contact creation
    ◦ Some contacts are in QAD but it's more for documents (invoices, credit notes...) so we will directly creates Contacts in SF (through file upload) and they will be manually maintained
    ◦ SF will be master for Contact
    ◦ In a V2, we can maybe plan an interface for SF to send the Contacts to QAD (if required by business)

On the PDP we have this green Available label that was on the Figma
 
But we have it on every single PDP, even when there is no price which is confusing for the customer because they cannot buy the product
 
 
 
Expected behavior
 
Ideally, we should only show this green Available label when there is a price
 
But if that's too complicated please juste remove it completely from all the PDP so there is no confusion

Story;CODEE01-67;Medium;Closed;[Integration] Integrate One Trust tool outcome for GDPR to eShop;27-03-2023;"As a business 

I want to follow the standard Business GDPR practise 

So that I can have clients data for future designer lytics




Acceptance Criteria
Assumption: GDPR compliance to be managed and implemented through One Trust, the Business tool that allows us to scan the eShop, classify the cookies,configure the cookie br, and manage geolocation rules.

From SF side the One Trust cookie br will be displayed

 

UPDATE BY projet manager ON 21/07

 

We need to create a cookie policy page as it's a legal page we must have on our eShop, the link to this cookie policy page will be present on the cookie br that we are configuring with the One Trust tool from Business. User 1 said we might be able to use a standard Experience Builder page and just add components.

 

The content of the page will be:
● The introduction text that is attached to this ticket => Maybe we can use a standard rich text area component
● A script to list the cookies on the eShop, it will be something like this (exact script to be confirmed, but it will be the same format):

<!-- OneTrust Cookies List start -->
<div id=""ot-sdk-cookie-policy""></div>
<!-- OneTrust Cookies List end -->

Example of the cookie policy page on their existing Wordpress website: https://www.business.com/cookie-policy/

 

We need the URL format of this page to be this as we have one cookie br configured in One Trust for the website and eShop so it has the same design: /legal/cookie-policy";;;;;

Please find attached the final product data that business cleaned up for our import on PROD for the go live, only refer to this file for the load on PROD:
● He cleaned up and removed a lot of duplicate and confusing cells
● He concatenated some of the fields he discussed with you in your last call 
● It's marked what should be loaded from this file / what data we should get from QAD (let's test with User 1 that it works, I think he wrote a script)
● Ignore the columns in red, he kept them so he can investigate internally
● He moved discontinued products to a new tab, ignore this

Story;CODEE01-405;Medium;Closed;Product description: Copy content from rich text area field to standard field;23-06-2023;"User 1User 2



We have 2 fields for the product description:
● 1 standard field
● 1 rich text area field => This cannot be indexed for search

We need to automatically copy the content from the rich text area field to the standard field so Business business does not need to modify the content in 2 different places

 

Note (Update from QA tester
● We cannot enter more than 4000 characters in the rich text area field because standard field can only contain 4000 or below characters.
● To make both fields have the same maximum number of characters, we can only change the rich text area field (by reducing it to 4000) because we cannot change the standard field. Will create a ticket to make this change and put in backlog.";;;;;

Story;CODEE01-471;Medium;Closed;Create role hierarchy;06-07-2023;"I discussed with User 1 from CRM team and we saw that we don't have any roles defined. 
 
Based on        CODEExx-xx    we were supposed to create a new node to put Business 1 and Business at the same level since Business has a different role hierarchy. And that each user should be attached to a role, for example User 2  & User 3 should be Customer Service manager, and User 3 & User 4 should be Customer Service.
 
But User 1 told me that it's not a simple task and it requires some rework. He was planning on using public queues to manage emails.

As discussed together:

Create a global action (it can be a lightning component or global quick action) to run price sync logic manually. On the global action page, try also to check if global sync batch job (by batch job name) is in progress to forbid running a new one.

Also create a product detail page quick action to run price sync only for certain product.

When price sync is started by clicking on the button, show the message - ""Price synchronization is in progress, please wait.""";;;;;

As a business
I want to eShop has custom style
So that I can have all platforms in one style and reduce clients confusion
 
 
 
Figma: https://www.monurl.com 
 
 
 
I'm creating this separate ticket for the recent orders component on the homepage so we can split the work of        CODEExx-xx   
 
 

● By default, the user's recent orders are shown here and if the user clicks on the very first field which is a drop down, they can select the other option which is the account's orders to have a global view of all the orders placed for this account (interesting when there are 2 or more users placing orders for 1 account)
● If the user selects the account's orders in the drop down, the component will update dynamically (the user won't have to click on ""apply"") 
● When clicking on start date and end date, a calendar should appear allowing the user to select their dates there and the user has to click on ""apply"" for the dates entered in the calendar to be taken into consideration => Unless you think it should also update automatically, but this can make it confusing since there are 2 date fields
● Clicking on ""reorder"" will automatically add all the products and quantities of that order in the cart
● Clicking on ""view detail"" will take the user to the order detail page where they can see all the information related to this order: products, quantities, prices, promotions, shipping address, billing address, creation date, status...
● Do you recommend to have the pagination at the bottom of this component when there are more than 5 recents orders or a ""see all orders"" button and when the user clicks on it they are redirected to the order history page? => Comment from Denis: I don't know whether we need to create Orders page according to initial requirements. If yes, then ""see all orders"" is easier, otherwise if Orders page is not in initial requirements then apart from Recent Orders component we will need to create ""Orders"" page. So I would say that both options are almost equal

Expected : Please upate this document, with all the evolutions that have been done, so he can really reflect what tagging plan is on, for each D8 website.

Story;CODE1ABCD-75;Medium;Closed;Clone feature;24-09-2021;"I have discovered two things when we clone a page that need discussion:

 

The first is that the page also clones the images.  I was surprised by this and don't think we want to clone the images but use the images that were defined in the page until which time a publisher uploads alternative images into the cloned page once they start editing. 

I also found it is cloning the term for the taxonomy.  This seems really funny because when you create new content it does not automatically create the taxonomy term but a cloned page does.  this actually creates some additional steps because then we need to delete the cloned items since we already created the taxonomy  Its easy to delete cloned items but it seems risky and unnecessary if we just don't let it create the taxonomy.

Pre conditions

Desktop:

The Industrial block while clicking on another industry in the vertical tabs

Mobile

Almost the same as desktop requirements for the user and the publisher.

The difference lies in the display and the style of some elements contained in the block :
● First, the user should only see the title of the Industrial block, and below the vertical tabs. No industry selected by default (background-color and text-color are the same for all the categories).
● A light blue down arrow invites the user to click on a tab. This down arrow is shown on each industry tab.
● The content associated to the industries is hidden : the user only see the name of industries in their vertical tabs.
● By clicking on an industry tab, the content is displayed below.
● The text-color of the selected industry turns light blue, and the down arrow becomes an up arrow (also in light blue).
● By clicking on the opened industry tab, the content is collapsed.
● In the illustration block, a single image is displayed, without any text or icons on it.
● The title of the industry is now displayed below the image.

In this list we displayed by defaut all document in english, even if active language of the website is polish or french.

The list is composed of : 
● ID 1 - Section title  : composed of  
    ◦ a picto 
    ◦ a label 
    ◦ the number of active filters in the following format ( x ) 
● ID 2 - Filters :

    ◦ Categories are displayed when there is at least one result matching.
    ◦ Categories to display (taxonomies): 
        ■ Document type 
        ■ Market  
        ■ Range  
        ■ User profile 
        ■ Region *
    ◦ Each terms will be displayed within the following format : ""term label ( x ) "" . In this case X = the number of existing results attached to the active filters. 
If two filters are selected, then result displayed should match to filter 1 AND filter 2.

    ◦ Active filters will be displayed : 
    ◦ User can remove a filter by clicking on x 
    ◦ User can remove all filters by clicking on ""Remove all filters""

This section is composed of the following section that editor canno't edit : 
● Text : Select your preferred language 
● Description : Some documents are translated in X different languages
    ◦ X  = number of languages available within the whole documents published
    ◦ X is not related to the result displayed
    ◦ X is not related to language selector of the website 
● Input select : List of the X languages
    ◦ By defaut English is selected (even if I'm consulting spanish or french website) 
    ◦ When user change language, we preselect it on ID9 for each content where active language is available 
ID 9 : Document available language

If document is available in the active preferred language ID 3 = ID 9 

If document is not available in the active preferred language D9 = English

 

Exemple 1 : My preferred language is english & every documents are available in english

        ■ ID9 = English for the document that are not available in french 
 

Exemple 3 : My preferred language is german & none of the result are translated into german

Examples of financial invoices: Financial Invoices Examples
 
Examples of credit notes: Credit Notes Examples

We cannot filter and just show invoices because there is no rule in the file name, so we need to show the last 20 documents on the account page for the MVP
 
You can put this new component below ADDRESS INFORMATION and name it: ACCOUNT DOCUMENTS
 
Can we take the same style as the RELATED DOCUMENTS component on the order detail page?
 
Can we change the disclaimer when there are no documents to: Your latest account documents will appear here.
 
Can we also add a disclaimer between the title and the table: To see all of your account documents, please see your order history [link to order history page].

Video Marketing

 

 
As a publisher, I want to get all the benefits that video marketing has to offer :

● Improved SEO referencing :

 
● 
    ◦ add, edit or remove pre-filled hidden fields in order to Optimize search on search engines
    ◦ add, edit or remove all SEO improvement techniques (metatags, ...) as defined by the business team
    ◦ Tracking measurements :

● add, edit or remove tracking of the moment when the user stops watching the video
● Facilitated sharing on social networks, in order to increase brand visibility and impact
    ◦ add, edit or remove video sharing features on social networks or by email
    ◦ hide or display the option allowing the user to subscribe to the brand's chl on Youtube videos

Source of the video

 
As a publisher, I should be able to choose bewteen different sources when adding a video : 


 
● Streamed from Youtube 
 
 
● Directly loaded to Drupal 8 only if streaming features are possible AL: we can use Media module to choose which media to select (youtube or video)

Video display settings**

 

 
As a publisher, I should be able to configure the video display settings :

● change the auto generated image with a specific thumbnail**

 
● configure a size for the video display, depending on whether some text is displayed or not, or if the element is on a narrow page or a full width page ...
● allow or not full size video
● hide or display video display settings for the user

 

 
As a user, I should be able to select between different sizes when I watch the video, if available :

● select the size of the video if this option is displayed (full screen for example)

 

Video player settings

 

 
As a publisher, I should be able to set up in the Back-office the video player settings :

● add, edit or remove the manual launch of the video by clicking on a ""Watch video"" icon.

 
● set up the start of the video at a very precise moment, by specifying the timecode.

● set up the YouTube's ""Enable privacy-enhanced mode"" option.
● display the replay at the end of the video instead of related videos.
● show or hide video player controls.
● show or hide Iframe borders*.*

Accessibility features**

● add, edit and remove a name for a video

 
● add, edit and remove metatags
● add, edit and remove subtitles and legend
● add, edit and remove video transcription

Layout of the video in the block

 

 
As a publisher, I should be able to define precisely where to display the elements inside the block :

● have the possibility to automatically size the video according to the size of the block

 
● define the alignement between the video and the other elements : top, bottom, right, left

Elements of the block

 

 
As a publisher, I want to build and design the block itself, and its components, with a maximum of flexibility

● entirely build and design the Video block in the Back-Office of the website

 
● display the Video block as a stand-alone component, or as a part of another component (Technical expertise needed : relevant to use the iFrame display ?), AL : We can use iframe or media embed mysiwyg
● display the Video block in any page or in any component of a page, as defined with the business during the setup phase.
● add, edit and remove the Video block
● adjust the size of the block
● design (with css styles or classes) the elements of the block (size, text-alignment, position of the elements, composition of the block ...

Nota bene : Except for the video, all other elements are optional and can be used independently
● Video Header (Text) : add, edit or remove - choice to display or hide
● Sub-Title (Text) : add, edit or remove - choice to display or hide
● Description : add, edit or remove - choice to display or hide
● URL Link : add, edit or remove - choice to display or hide
● Images (logo, small picture or thumbnail) : add, edit or remove - choice to display or hide
● Video: add, edit the settings, remove
● Multiple video block:
● 
    ◦ 
        ■ add, edit, remove
● 
    ◦ 
        ■ apply styles on the component to display the videos in tabs
● 
    ◦ 
        ■ order the videos

Whenever it is possible, the publisher should have at its disposal a rich text editor (WYSIWYG editor).

*****************************************

Pre-conditions:

Desktop : 

A video block is a block providing to the user a video at the most relevant areas on the website.
